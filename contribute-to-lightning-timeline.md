# How can you get involved?
The whole timeline is open source and available on Github.
If you want to change something about the website itself, [this](https://github.com/gcomte/gcomte.github.io/blob/master/lightning-timeline.md) is the file you need to make changes in.
If you want to add, adapt or remove data from the timeline, you'll find all of that in [this JSON file](https://github.com/gcomte/gcomte.github.io/blob/master/LightningTimeline/data.json).
If you want to run a version of the Lightning Timeline locally on your computer, please check out [these instructions](https://github.com/gcomte/gcomte.github.io/tree/master/LightningTimeline).

# Pull Requests are welcome!
... but not necessarily merged. The aim is not to overload the timeline with data, but to keep it a nice overview over the most important things. Less is more!


# English language
Since I am not a native speaker of the English language, I'd be particularly happy for some people more skilled than me to reformulate my bad language so English natives won't get any headache while clicking through the timeline ;-)
